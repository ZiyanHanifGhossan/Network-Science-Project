This code provides a solution to a problem where you need to select the best subset of locations to visit within certain constraints (such as time or budget), rather than visiting all locations as in the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

This code implements the **Orienteering Problem** using the CPLEX solver through the **docplex** library. The objective is to find a route that maximizes the total value (rating) of the locations visited, while considering the budget constraint.
